Daily Herald School Report Card files
===============

Our [Daily Herald School Checker](http://reportcards.dailyherald.com) displays the latest information from Illinois' State Report Cards, as well as results of our deep data dive into low income and Illinois State Report Cards.

Raw assessment data is available through the public ISBE FTP site at ftp.isbe.net. The guide to the scores and demographic data is in a file called RC15_assessment_layout.xlsx in rc2015/python scripts/rc15csv. 

Summary school data can be found in the sch2015.xlsx file, in rc2015/python scripts/rc15csv. That contains a worksheet with a guide to the columns.
